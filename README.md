### Overview

* Burger Appetite is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* When you a submit a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat me!` button. When you click it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
